# 3d parts for a Case

We've designed 3D case parts inspired by the Game Genie. Our goal is to use them with our miniaturized circuit in the future, with only minor modifications. We're sharing them now so the community can use them as a starting point to improve the design with better ideas—or even as a replacement for a Game Genie shell!

## License

These files are licensed for non-commercial use (CC-BY-NC-4.0) since they were created using Autodesk Fusion under a non-commercial license. However, we may recreate them in an open-source CAD program in the future to allow for a more permissive license.

## Files

- f3d files – Autodesk Fusion files that can be modified.
- stl files – Ready-to-print models (though we recommend waiting until we finalize the miniaturized PCB and overall design).
